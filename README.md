Computer Science protfolio for my college application; sorted by if I wrote it for class vs for fun, then by what programming language it is written in, then by the program itself. Each program has a brief description about what it does. (Note: This portfolio was finalized at the end of October when my first college application was submitted. The only change since then was this note.)
